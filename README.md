# Device-Database

This is my first Electron project. It is a device database to manage devices in your organization. You can create them, search for them and manage models, manufactors, types and so on. The frontend is Electron. In the backend i used an express api with a mysql database. You can find the MySQL schema under the backend folder. 

The project is now a mess, but it worked :D There are many messy code snippets, it was my first project. I will work on that an refactor my code.

## Installation

You can build the app on your own or use the installer for windows. You can find then in the folder frontend>installer.

You can build the app via npm. Got to the frontend folder and execute:

```
npm run make
```
For the backend you can start it via:
```
node .\main.js
```
